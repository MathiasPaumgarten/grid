=== Grid

__WORK IN PROGRESS__


So far this is a small sketch that creates a grid out of one consecutive line, with many branches, in
case it runs into a dead end. The algorithm is based on the walking pattern of a confused teenager in a
mall. It gets distracted easily but never gives up. Eventually it will have covered the whole space.
